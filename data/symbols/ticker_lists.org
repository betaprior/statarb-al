Current ticker universe:
spx_tickers_20081107.txt
SPX symbols as of 20081107
Russell tickers are derived from Russell 3000 index constituents as of
06/2001 (freshest I could find);
R1Khalf2K-0106.txt takes R1000 tickers and concatenates with the first 1000
of the R2000 tickers (individually sorted by market cap in descending order),
i.e. it captures large and mid-caps
There are 79 symbols that are in the Nov 2008 SPX set but aren't captured in
the Jun 2001 Russell set, including e.g. GOOG that had its IPO after 2001 and
JAVA that changed the ticker.  They are listed below:
